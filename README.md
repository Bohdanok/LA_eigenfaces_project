# PCA-based face recognition

structure:
eigenfaces.ipyng has implementation of our algorithm with explanations and test for one person.<br>
eigenfaces\_model.py has all of implementation structured in a class which can be easily used for training and testing data.<br>
eigenfaces\_model\_optimised.py has optimised version, but for know it has worse accuracy(83\%).<br>
accuracy\_testing.py this script is used for testing implementations.<br>
